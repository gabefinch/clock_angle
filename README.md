# clock_angle
An exercise from the first day of Epicodus.  A collaboration between Sarah Joy Calpo and Gabe Finch. Sinatra web app built on a simple Ruby method. Created day 1 of Epicodus.
A method that tells us, given a certain time, the distance between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock.
Built out with Sinatra later that first week.
